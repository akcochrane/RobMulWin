## Overview to RobMulWin

Outliers are a pervasive problem in many forms of data analysis, and these problematic observations can be even more insidious as the number of variables increases.
Outliers may be univariate, multivariate, or both [Leys et al., 2018](10.1016/j.jesp.2017.09.011).

If you use the functions in published work, please this package using the [Zenodo DOI ](10.5281/zenodo.10475282). Thanks!

## Installing the package

The R package `devtools` includes a very easy way to install packages from Github.

```
devtools::install_github('akcochrane/RobMulWin', build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
