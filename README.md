## Overview to RobMulWin

Outliers are a pervasive problem in many forms of data analysis, and
these problematic observations can be even more insidious as the number
of variables increases. Outliers may be univariate, multivariate, or
both [Leys et al., 2018](10.1016/j.jesp.2017.09.011).

If you use the functions in published work, please this package using
the [Zenodo DOI](10.5281/zenodo.10475282). Thanks!

## Installing the package

The R package `devtools` includes a very easy way to install packages
from Github.
